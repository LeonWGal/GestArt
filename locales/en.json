    "About GestArt Text": "GestArt is an image viewer created to help artists practice gesture drawing, study poses and view reference images.\n\nFor years I used another program and was dissatisfied with some of its aspects. Honestly, I don't know how to program myself. I spent many months fighting with AI that often completely broke the app, but now you have this program, written by AI based on my concept. It was decided to make the program completely open and free to use, distribute and modify.\n\nCredits: Concept — LeonWGal; Code — Cursor; Countdown sound — Mixkit; Icons — Tabler\n\nBelow are my links where you can contact or support me. I should warn you that I am mainly an NSFW artist, so please be careful.",
